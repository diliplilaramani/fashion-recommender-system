# Optimization

## This project will work fast enough till 50K images but what about 100 million images?

## Solution: To optimize this to work on millions of images, we can use ANNOY library by Spotify.
### https://github.com/spotify/annoy
### https://pypi.org/project/annoy/1.0.3/
### To do nearest neighbor search. Annoy is almost as fast as the fastest libraries
